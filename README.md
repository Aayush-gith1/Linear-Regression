# Ecommerce Customer Analysis with Linear Regression

This project uses **Python** and **Linear Regression** to analyze Ecommerce customer data and predict spending behavior based on features like session time, time spent on the website and app, and length of membership.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **File:** `Ecommerce Customers.csv`  
- **Description:** Contains customer demographics, spending scores, and engagement metrics such as:
  - Average Session Length
  - Time on App
  - Time on Website
  - Length of Membership

## ðŸ›  Methodology
1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**  
   - Check for missing values, outliers, and correlations  
   - Visualize relationships between features and spending  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Split data into training and testing sets  
   - Train a **Linear Regression** model  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
   - Analyze residuals and model performance visually
